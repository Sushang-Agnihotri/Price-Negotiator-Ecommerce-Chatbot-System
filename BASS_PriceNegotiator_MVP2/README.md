# BASS Price Negotiator
In this project artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques are applied innovatively to an ecommerce website introducing a new perspective to online shopping with artificial agents. This project presents an aspect of negotiating and bargaining online and features a bargain-based e-commerce website, where chatbot acts as a shopkeeper and can negotiate the price of a product with the customer and a content-based recommendation system that recommends similar products based on product attributes and description rather than on likings and ratings from customers. The chatbot is developed using deep learning algorithms combined with the natural language processing techniques. The recommendation system is developed using natural language processing algorithms. This project is implemented using modern tools and technologies like Python, Flask and Machine learning libraries Scikit-Learn and Keras.
